# Scientific Calculator
📐 Day 7 – Scientific Calculator with Trigonometric Functions (C++)
📌 Overview

Day 7 of my coding challenge focuses on building a menu-driven scientific calculator using C++. This program supports basic arithmetic operations along with advanced trigonometric calculations, where results are displayed for angles considered in both degrees and radians.

The project emphasizes logical flow control, mathematical computation, and proper angle conversion techniques required for accurate trigonometric evaluation in C++.

➖ Subtraction

✖ Multiplication

➗ Division (with division-by-zero handling)

🔢 Modulus operation

📐 Trigonometric functions:

Sine

Cosine

Tangent

Cotangent

Secant

Cosecant

📊 Trigonometric results displayed using:

Degree input

Radian conversion

🔁 Continuous execution using a loop until user exits

🧠 Key Concepts Used

Menu-driven programming

switch-case statements

do-while loop

Mathematical functions from <cmath>

Degree to radian conversion using:

radians = degrees × π / 180


Input validation and error handling

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++

Libraries: <iostream>, <cmath>

▶ How to Run

Compile the program:

g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator


Execute the program:

./calculator


Follow the on-screen menu instructions.

🎯 Learning Outcome
